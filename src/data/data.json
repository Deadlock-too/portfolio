      "content": "<h3>How it started</h3><p>It all started at the beginning of 2023 when my girlfriend was relocating to Parma further her studies. At the time, I was working as a junior bakend developer at Tecsis S.r.l., focusing on backend solutions. I was offered a generous remote work agreement, so I decided to take the opportunity and move with her. Feeling the stress of thight deadlines, I sought something new to learn. Fascinated by the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking, I began studying in my free time. Eventually, I decided to pursue it <span style=\"text-wrap: nowrap\">full-time</span>, leaving my job in June 2023.</p><h3>First steps</h3><p>My introduction to cybersecurity started with cryptography. I delved into books and videos, grasping the basics of encryption and decryption. I also familiarized myself with ethical hacking tools like Nmap, Wireshark and Metasploit, and learned about web application security using tools such as Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP. Additionally, I explored Linux and Windows security, learning how to use tools like Powershell and Bash, and how to exploit Active Directory and Kerberos vulnerabilities.</p><h3>Testing the knowledge</h3>\n<p>After months of solitary study, I decided to put my knowledge to the test. I started testing my skills on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, trying to solve the challenges proposed by the platform. Starting with the easiest challenges, I quickly realized my limitations. Taking a step back, I revisited the basics, this time focusing on the practical part.</p><h3>Trying again</h3><p>Months of study and practice led me to try again. Despite some initial progress, I found myself struggling with even some of the easier challenges, not being able to solve them without looking at the solutions. I started to feel frustrated and demotivated.</p><h3>Realization</h3><p>While the subject intrigued me, I came to the trealization that cybersecurity might not be my calling. The stress and demands outweighed my enjoyment, and I lacked the mindset of a professional in the field. Accepting this, I refocused on my development work, contemplating venturing into some frontend development.</p><h3>Back to Development</h3><p>Studying new technologies, I embarked on some personal projects that I'm yet to complete:<ul><li><a href=\"/project/another-password-manager\" target=\"_blank\">Another Password Manager</a> - A simple password manager written in TypeScript, using the Electron to ease the cross-platform development.</li><li><a href=\"/project/creative-hobbies-web-site\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Hobbies</a> - An E-Commerce website made for my girlfriend and her handcrafting hobbies.</li><li><a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\">This</a> - A portfolio website to showcase my work and experiences.</li></ul></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Though my brief journey into cybersecurity didn't yield the success I had hoped for, I cherish the experience. It taught me valuable lessons about risk-taking, resilience, and adaptability. While it wasn't the right fit for me, I'm unafraid of failure, and I embrace the opportunity to explore new paths.</p>"

I've also worked on the development and maintenance of an infrastructure based on microservices, using Docker and Kubernetes in the Azure Cloud environment. Over the course of this first work experience, I also acquired experience in the development of integration solutions with third-party services, such as PagoPA and Moodle. Even if my principal focus was on the backend, I've also started approaching the frontend world, acquiring some basic knowledge of Javascript, Typescript and the React library."
