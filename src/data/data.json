      "content": "<h3>How it started</h3><p>It all started at the beginning of 2023 when my girlfriend was relocating to Parma to further her studies. At the time, I was working as a junior bakend developer at Tecsis S.r.l., focusing on backend solutions. I was offered a generous remote work agreement, so I decided to take the opportunity and move with her. Feeling the stress of thight deadlines, I sought something new to learn. Fascinated by the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking, I began studying in my free time. Eventually, I decided to pursue it <span style=\"text-wrap: nowrap\">full-time</span>, leaving my job in June 2023.</p><h3>First steps</h3><p>My introduction to cybersecurity started with cryptography. I delved into books and videos, grasping the basics of encryption and decryption. I also familiarized myself with ethical hacking tools like Nmap, Wireshark and Metasploit, and learned about web application security using tools such as Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP. Additionally, I explored Linux and Windows security, learning how to use tools like Powershell and Bash, and how to exploit Active Directory and Kerberos vulnerabilities.</p><h3>Testing the knowledge</h3>\n<p>After months of solitary study, I decided to put my knowledge to the test. I started testing my skills on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, trying to solve the challenges proposed by the platform. Starting with the easiest challenges, I quickly realized my limitations. Taking a step back, I revisited the basics, this time focusing on the practical part.</p><h3>Trying again</h3><p>Months of study and practice led me to try again. Despite some initial progress, I found myself struggling with even some of the easier challenges, not being able to solve them without looking at the solutions. I started to feel frustrated and demotivated.</p><h3>Realization</h3><p>While the subject intrigued me, I came to the trealization that cybersecurity might not be my calling. The stress and demands outweighed my enjoyment, and I lacked the mindset of a professional in the field. Accepting this, I refocused on my development work, contemplating venturing into some frontend development.</p><h3>Back to Development</h3><p>Studying new technologies, I embarked on some personal projects that I'm yet to complete:<ul><li><a href=\"/project/another-password-manager\" target=\"_blank\">Another Password Manager</a> - A simple password manager written in TypeScript, using the Electron to ease the cross-platform development.</li><li><a href=\"/project/creative-hobbies-web-site\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Hobbies</a> - An E-Commerce website made for my girlfriend and her handcrafting hobbies.</li><li><a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\">This</a> - A portfolio website to showcase my work and experiences.</li></ul></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Though my brief journey into cybersecurity didn't yield the success I had hoped for, I cherish the experience. It taught me valuable lessons about risk-taking, resilience, and adaptability. While it wasn't the right fit for me, I'm unafraid of failure, and I embrace the opportunity to explore new paths.</p>"

Even if my principal focus was on the backend, I've also started approaching the frontend world, acquiring some basic knowledge of Javascript, Typescript and the React library.",
